    "\n",
    "**Overview**: in this lab, we will explore the question of whether stronger rule of law is associated with higher levels of foreign direct investment into a country (as a % of GDP). As we are using a panel dataset of countries' data over time, we use fixed and random effects models to account for possible unobservable differences across countries and years in our analysis. We also consider a third variable, corruption, which we think may account for the relationship between rule of law and foreign direct investment levels."
