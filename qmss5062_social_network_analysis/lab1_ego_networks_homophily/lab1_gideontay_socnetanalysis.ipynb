        "Model 5 considers if there is an interaction between the effect of social circle racial homopily and age. The intuition here being that older people's views toward interracial marriage may be more deep-seated due to the environment in which they grew up in and the possibility that odler folk face greater inertia in changing their views. Then, we will expect the interaction to have a positive coefficient, indicating that age reduces the effect that lower racial homophily (greater racial heterophily) has on attitudes toward anti-interracial marriage laws."

An increase of 1 unit of `racehomo` lowers the log odds of thinking that there should be laws against marriages between blacks and whites by 3.8553, net of other factors. This is much larger than our prior estimates. However, every additional year of a person's age reduces this effect's magnitude by 0.0604.\n",
