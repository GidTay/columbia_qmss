# Note on QMSS5015
This course was rather rudimentary, and I knew all the content beforehand and have used it in various roles in the past. Nevertheless, I included some assignments here to show that I possess these basic skills as well.

Note that this course and the assignments here are entirely descriptive, with little attention paid to causal effects.
