# Final project for QMSS5072 Modern Data Structures
The final project requires us to build and deploy a data-focused python package from scratch.

I built [sgfixedincome_pkg](https://github.com/GidTay/sgfixedincome_pkg), a python package to aggregate and analyse data on SGD-denominated retail fixed income products in Singapore.
